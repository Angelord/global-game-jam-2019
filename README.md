## Treehouse Trouble

### About
This project was developed for the 2019 Plovdiv Game Jam, which is a part of Global Game Jam.

You play as two kids who protect their treehouse from all sorts of spooky monsters.

A working build, as well as additional info, can be found on the game's itch.io page : https://angelord.itch.io/treehouse-trouble
